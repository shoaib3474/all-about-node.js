📄 REST API & HTTP Methods - Basics

🔗 What is a REST API?

REST stands for Representational State Transfer.
A REST API is a web service that allows clients (like browsers, mobile apps) to communicate with a server using standard HTTP methods.

It follows simple principles:
- Stateless (no session stored on server)
- Uniform interface (uses standard HTTP methods)
- Resource-based (everything is a resource: users, posts, products, etc.)

🔧 Common HTTP Methods in REST API

1. GET
- 🔍 Used to retrieve data from the server.
- Does not change anything on the server.
- Example:
  GET /users
  GET /products/5

---

2. POST
- ➕ Used to create a new resource on the server.
- Sends data in the request body (usually in JSON format).
- Example:
  POST /users
  Body: { "name": "Ali", "age": 25 }

---

3. PUT
- 📝 Used to update a resource completely.
- Replaces the entire existing resource.
- Example:
  PUT /users/1
  Body: { "name": "Ali Updated", "age": 26 }

---

4. PATCH
- ✏️ Used to partially update a resource.
- Only the provided fields are updated.
- Example:
  PATCH /users/1
  Body: { "age": 30 }

---

5. DELETE
- ❌ Used to remove a resource from the server.
- Example:
  DELETE /users/1

---

✅ REST API Response Format

- Usually returns JSON
- Example response from GET /users/1:
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Ali",
    "age": 25
  }
